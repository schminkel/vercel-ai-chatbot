# Soft Delete Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `deleteChatById` Function
**Location**: `/lib/db/queries.ts`

**Before**: Permanently deleted chat, messages, votes, streams, and S3 files
**After**: Sets `hidden = true` (soft delete)

```typescript
// New implementation - simple and fast
export async function deleteChatById({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const [hiddenChat] = await db
    .update(chat)
    .set({ hidden: true })
    .where(eq(chat.id, id))
    .returning();
  return hiddenChat;
}
```

### 2. Added `hardDeleteChatById` Function
**Location**: `/lib/db/queries.ts`

**Purpose**: Provides the original permanent deletion functionality for administrative use

```typescript
export async function hardDeleteChatById({ id }: { id: string }) {
  // Original deletion logic - removes all data permanently
}
```

### 3. Updated Utility Functions
**Location**: `/lib/db/hidden-chat-utils.ts`

Added new utility functions for different types of deletion:

```typescript
softDeleteChat(chatId)        // Calls deleteChatById (soft delete)
permanentlyDeleteChat(chatId) // Calls hardDeleteChatById (hard delete)
```

### 4. Updated Documentation
**Location**: `/docs/HIDDEN_CHATS.md`

- Explained soft delete vs hard delete behavior
- Updated use cases and security considerations
- Added migration notes for backward compatibility

### 5. Added Test Templates
**Location**: `/tests/e2e/hidden-chats.test.ts`

Added test template for soft delete behavior verification

### 6. Created Demo Script
**Location**: `/scripts/demo-soft-delete.ts`

Educational script explaining the differences between soft and hard delete

## Behavior Changes

### User-Facing Behavior (Unchanged)
- Users click "delete" button
- Chat disappears from sidebar immediately
- Chat becomes inaccessible via URL
- API calls return 404

### Backend Behavior (Changed)
- **Before**: Data permanently removed
- **After**: Data preserved with `hidden = true`

### Administrative Options (New)
- Soft delete: `deleteChatById()` or `softDeleteChat()`
- Hard delete: `hardDeleteChatById()` or `permanentlyDeleteChat()`
- Restore: Set `hidden = false` using `unhideChat()`

## Benefits

1. **Data Preservation**: Chat history preserved for compliance/audit
2. **Reversibility**: Accidental deletions can be recovered
3. **Performance**: Faster deletion (single UPDATE vs complex cascade)
4. **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing code
5. **User Experience**: Same UI behavior, better data protection

## Migration Notes

- **Existing Code**: No changes required - `deleteChatById()` calls continue to work
- **Database**: Requires migration to add `hidden` column
- **API**: No breaking changes to endpoints
- **UI**: No changes required - delete buttons work the same way

## Security & Compliance

- **GDPR**: Hard delete still available for data removal requests
- **Privacy**: Soft deleted chats completely hidden from users
- **Audit**: Data preservation supports compliance requirements
- **Recovery**: Administrators can restore accidentally deleted data

## Testing

Run tests to verify:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Check the implementation:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/demo-soft-delete.ts
```

## Next Steps

1. Apply database migration: `npm run db:migrate`
2. Test in development environment
3. Consider adding UI for administrators to manage hidden chats
4. Monitor performance impact (should be positive due to simpler deletion)
5. Plan for periodic hard deletion of old hidden chats if storage is a concern
